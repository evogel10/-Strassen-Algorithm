The source code in this assignment can be compiled from the command line in the Terminal.

To compile the program, locate the directory where the files are in and enter: javac EVogelLab1.java MatrixGenerator.java MatrixMultiplier.java StrassenAlgorithm.java Stopwatch.java

To run the program, locate the directory where the complied files are in and enter: java EVogelLab1 Input.txt Output.txt

The program will read in the Input.txt file and write to the Output.txt file the product of the matrices and how long a regular multiplication method and Strassen's Method took in nanoseconds.
